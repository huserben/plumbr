## Plumbr
Azure DevOps Extension that shows Pipeline Status and allows to approve stages and custom variable group configuration.

The structure of this extension was heavily influenced by the [azure-devops-extension-sample](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-devops-extension-sample).

# Contribute
This extension was made as a hobby project for me to learn more about Azure DevOps extensions, Typescript and React. I expect that there are some things that won't work as you would expect them. As this extension is maintained in my free time, I cannot guarantee that any of the feedbacks will be implemented. However I do appreciate getting feedbacks in case you have questions, found a problem or have a proposal for a new feature.

I am aware that the code is probably not optimal as I'm not an expert in Typescript and an absolute beginner in React.
Unit Tests are missing and no continuous integration is setup as of now.

If you would like to contribute, I'm happy for tips or even pull requests.

# Build
Just run:

```
    yarn install
    yarn build
```

This produces a .vsix file that can be uploaded to the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/azuredevops)
